  <p>Students will be graded in six areas: Pre-Program Survey, Labs/Google Classroom Assignments,	Participation,	Attendance,	Post-Program Survey, and Final Project</p>

  <h1>Pre-Program Survey</h1>
    <p>The pre-program survey is needed from all learners and counts for 1/5 of you final grade. The link to the survey can be found <a href="#">here:</a> </p>

  <h1>Labs/Google Classroom Assignments</h1>
    <p>Exit tickets must be submitted after each lecture session.</p>

  <h1>Participation</h1>
    <p>Particaipation is essential to the Hack the Hood experience and will be evaluated by your instructors. Examples of poor participation are: Camera always off, not contributing to team building exercises, not offering solutions to group coding sessions.</p>

  <h1>Attendance</h1>
    <p>Attendance is crucial to staying in the Build program. More than three unexcused absences may result in the removal of a student from the program. Please reach out to your instructor before a missed session to make sure the approprate notes are added to the attendance sheet.</p>

  <h1>Post-Program Survey</h1>
    <p>The post-program survey is needed from all learners. The survey will be released in the last month of the Build program.</p>

  <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <p>Once the asyncronus period starts, learners will meet with their project group and instructor once a week to finish their final project (each group will choose the days and times). There will be NO lectures or Tiger Team sessions. The final project counts for 1/5 of your final grade. </p>
