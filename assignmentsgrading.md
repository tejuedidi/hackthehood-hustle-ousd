<h1><b>Assignments & Grading</b></h1>

<body>
  <p>Students will be graded in six areas: Pre-Program Survey, Labs/Google Classroom Assignments,	Participation,	Attendance,	Post-Program Survey, and the Final Project.</p>

  <h2>Pre-Program Survey</h2>
    <p>The pre-program survey is needed from all learners and counts for $50 of your final stipend. You can find the survey <a href="https://corexmsp4sy8p6bphbs3.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_868cbkmwljABiSO">here</a>. </p>

  <h2>Labs/Google Classroom Assignments</h2>
    <p>Exit tickets must be submitted to the appropriate Google Classroom assignment after each lecture session. There will also be Tiger Teams assignments and other assignments due on Google Classroom. Completion of these assignments will contribute to $100 of your final stipend.</p>

  <h2>Participation</h2>
    <p>Participation is essential to the Hack the Hood experience and will be evaluated by your instructors. Examples of poor participation are: Camera always off, not contributing to team building exercises, not offering solutions to group coding sessions, or not asking questions. Participation will contribute to $100 of your final stipend. </p>

  <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>Attendance is crucial to staying in the Hustle program. More than three unexcused absences may result in the removal of a student from the program. Please reach out to your instructors before a missed session to make sure the appropriate notes are added to the attendance sheet. Attendance will contribute to $100 of your final stipend. </p>

  <h2>Post-Program Survey</h2>
    <p>The post-program survey is needed from all learners. The survey will be released in the last month of the Hustle program and the link will be posted here once it is released. Completion of the post-program survey will count for $50 of your final stipend. </p>

  <h2>Final Project</h2>
    <p>Once the asynchronous period starts, learners will meet with their Tiger Team and instructor once a week to finish their final project (each group will choose the days and times). There will be NO formal lectures or Tiger Team sessions. Completion of the final project will contribute $100 of your final stipend. </p>
